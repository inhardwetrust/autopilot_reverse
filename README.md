<h1>Demo stm32 with mpu6050 gyroscope. Flight controller NBOne - reverse engineering</h1>

<p>NBOne is a cheap flight controller made with stm32 and mpu6050 on board. 4 input ports, 4 output ports.</p>
It was a try to make own firmware for flight controller. Learning to work with gyroscope, servos, and input pwm.</p>

How the board is working: Getting input data from mpu6050 and Servo Tester (PWM). All data is mixed and controls servos for Ailerons. Changing Roll and Pitch.</p>
